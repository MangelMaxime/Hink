**Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde** is the original
title of a novella written by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson
that was first published in 1886. The work is commonly known today as
**The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde**,
**Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde**, or simply
**Jekyll & Hyde**.
It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson
who investigates strange occurrences between
his old friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, and the evil Edward Hyde.

The work is commonly associated with the rare mental condition often called
"split personality", referred to in psychiatry as dissociative identity disorder,
where within the same body there exists more than one distinct personality.
In this case, there are two personalities within Dr Jekyll, one apparently good
and the other evil. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of
the language, with the very phrase "Jekyll and Hyde" coming to mean a person
who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.

> I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.
